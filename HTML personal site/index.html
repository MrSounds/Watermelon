  <p>Now. You may have heard a lot of talk about the apple. Sure. We all have.
    Apple this. Apple that. But what about the watermelon? It's round, it's oval, it's squared, it's motherfucking heart-shaped!
    Beat that, you ass-shaped apple.</p>

    <h3>Types of watermelon</h3>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Normalmelon:</strong> It's like Shrek. Green as danish beer on the outside, red as normal red blood on the inside. You know it.
      It's the normalmelon. <br />It also contains tiny black seeds. They serve no purpose.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Honeyfuck:</strong> This melon is like our asian friends. Tasty. It comes in a beautiful yellow cover, usually in a hard texture.
      <br />Inside you will find what smells like honeyfuck. It's white and guishy. It's sweet and softy.
